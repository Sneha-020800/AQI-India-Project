# AQI-India-Analysis
Air Quality Index (AQI) analysis of Indian cities (2015–2020) using Excel with visualizations of pollutants, seasonal trends, regional patterns, and an interactive dashboard.
🌏 Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis of India (2015–2020)

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Indian cities between 2015 and 2020 using Excel.
The dataset includes city-level air quality data with key pollutants, AQI values, and AQI buckets.
The goal of this project is to visualize trends, identify major pollutants, and highlight seasonal and regional patterns in India’s air quality.

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:

City: Amravati, Amritsar, Chandigarh, Delhi, Gurugram, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Patna, Visakhapatnam, etc.

Date, Month, Year: Data from 2015–2020.

Pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO2, NOx, NH3, CO, SO2, O3, benzene, toluene, xylene.

AQI (Air Quality Index).

AQI Bucket: Good, Satisfactory, Moderate, Poor, Very Poor, Severe.

🛠 Methods & Tools

Excel (Pivot Tables, Formulas, Conditional Formatting, Charts, Dashboard).

Data Cleaning: Extracted Month & Year from Date column.

Formulas: Used IF conditions to classify AQI into buckets.

Visualization: Created heatmaps, bar charts, pie charts, and maps.

📈 Key Visualizations

1. Heatmap – Monthly trends of major pollutants.
   
2. City vs Major Pollutants – Comparison of O3, SO2, CO, NO2 across cities.

3. Gurugram AQI – Distribution of AQI buckets in Gurugram.

4. Month vs AQI – Seasonal variation (Highest in November, lowest in August).

5. Year vs Major Pollutants – Trends of CO, SO2, NO2, and O3 from 2015–2020.

6. State vs PM2.5 Map – Highest PM2.5 in Bihar and UP, lowest in southern states.

7. State vs AQI Bucket – Comparison of average AQI categories across states.
   
8. Final Dashboard – Combined all charts in one interactive view.

🔑 Insights

Winter months (Nov–Jan) are the most polluted; monsoon months (Jul–Sep) are the cleanest.

Ozone (O3) and NO2 are the dominant pollutants.

North India (Delhi, Gurugram, Bihar, UP) is more vulnerable to particulate pollution than southern states.

Gurugram often falls into Poor to Very Poor AQI categories.

📌 Conclusion

This project highlights India’s air pollution challenges across time, location, and pollutant type.
The insights can help policymakers and researchers understand patterns and take data-driven decisions for pollution control.
